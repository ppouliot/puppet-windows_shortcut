the fancy stuff with your module here.

## Reference

This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so
people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess
with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc **Optional**
